When you have completed this milestone you will have web pages hosted from your custom domain.

## Introduction 

In class we setup Docker and created a microservice. For this milestone you'll get a web page up after following the instructions here:
 [Docker Microservice](dockerfile_and_container_management.html)

Double check your setup with a browser as instructed in the HowTo. On canvas you will submit two URLs. One for each of the virtual hosts.

## Turn In 

  - A URL that links to your microservice
  - The output of the command "docker ps"

Submit your homework on canvas.
