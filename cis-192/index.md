Course Description 
Students will learn how networking is implemented on UNIX/Linux Systems. Emphasis is on the TCP/IP suite of protocols in the 192A section, with the course concentrating on the functionality of each layer of the TCP/IP Network Model, and the Linux commands and utilities used for administering the network. In the 192B course, students will also learn to install and configure network applications including DHCP, DNS, and web-based services such as FTP, HTTP and email. The course also covers firewalls and various WAN technologies including Virtual Private Networks. This course readies the student for Linux network administration by giving them first hand experience creating a functional domain and website.
Student Learner Outcomes
  - Install and configure a local area network (LAN) that meets the needs of a small business.
  - Install and configure common network services.
  - Troubleshoot and repair malfunctions in common network services.

Objectives

  - Use basic network terminology to describe the five layers of the TCP/IP Reference Model, and describe at least one major function of each layer.
  - Locate a specific Request For Comment (RFC) article on the Internet.
  - Use the arpwatch daemon to collect IP/hardware addresses, and manually add an address to the ARP table.
  - Install the device drivers and configure the network interface card (NIC) of a Linux system so that it may join a network.
  - Configure appropriate IP addresses, network and subnet masks, and broadcast addresses based on the size and number of network segments required.
  - Connect multiple network segments together using Linux servers as routers and configuring the appropriate routing tables.
  - Use a network sniffer to analyze network traffic between two hosts.
  - Plan a subnet topology based upon a given set of constraints and performance needs.
  - Define the term 'socket' and describe its importance to the transport layer of the protocol stack.
  - Create a secure tunnel between two hosts that allows port forwarding into a private network.
  - Configure a network service with security restrictions for its use using either TCP Wrappers or a super daemon.
  - Use Iptables to build a permissive firewall by selectively filtering packets based on protocol type.
  - Use Network Address Translation (NAT) to allow hosts on a private network to access the Internet.
  - Identify, isolate, and correct malfunctions in a computer network.

TBA (To Be Arranged) Lab Hours 
This course meets weekly at the times shown in the Cabrillo Schedule of Classes and above. In addition each student is required to spend lab time every week in either the CIS Lab (room 830) or online using the CIS VLab. Students may choose the time and day for their TBA Lab Hours where they will work on lab assignments designed to give them practical hands-on experience and continue the learning process. These TBA lab hours are required, tracked, and graded. It is the studentâs responsibility to complete the TBA lab hours, which start on Week 1 of the term, and record their attendance. Tip: A great time to do TBA lab hours is in the CIS Lab when the instructor is there. If that is not possible, questions can always be posted on the electronic help forum which is monitored by the instructor.
Late Work Will Not Be AcceptedHomework is dueone hourbefore class on the calendar date where the homework is listed.Please complete all assignments on time as they will not be accepted if they are late. This will help both the student and instructor keep the class moving and avoid log jams at the end of the term. If an assignment is not complete by the deadline it is better to make an incomplete submission for partial credit than no submission at all. There may be extra credit work for students needing extra points.

Classroom Etiquette 
It is important to have an effective, distraction-free classroom environment for learning. To minimize distractions all cell-phones should be turned off or at least silenced. Never carry on conversations during the lecture as this is probably the most annoying distraction possible to those sitting nearby.
 
 For students in the physical classroom, computers can be turned on for viewing lecture slides locally, Google-ing related technical information, and doing classroom exercises. A student's full attention is desired so the computers should not be used during lecture for email or anything that would distract them or others from the material being taught.
 
 For students in the virtual classroom, use the "Raise hand" icon in CCC Confer to let the instructor know you have a question. The chat window can be used to ask questions and communicate with the instructor or other classmates. For students dialing in please use *6 on your phone to mute/unmute your line so background noises in your location don't distract the class.
 
 Please plan on coming to all classes. If class will be missed let the instructor know ahead of time. It is the student's responsibility to get any missed material or information from other classmates (the forum is a good way to do this). Please note that being disruptive is grounds for being dropped from the class by the instructor.
 
Academic ConductInstructors at Cabrillo will not tolerate any forms of academic dishonesty. We do not accept remarkably similar assignments. Students who engage in violations of academic integrity (cheating, plagiarizing print or electronic sources, copying computer files, web site content) as outlined in Cabrillo's "[Student Rights and Responsibilities"](http://www.cabrillo.edu/services/studentaffairs/documents/rightsresponsibilities.pdf) document are subject to disciplinary action by the instructor including receiving an "F" for the assignment, being dropped from the course with a "W" or being issued an "F" for the course.
 
Special Learning NeedsVeterans or students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning, and psychological disabilities, are encouraged to explain their needs and appropriate accommodations to the instructor during office hours. Please bring a verification of your disability from the Learning Skills or DSPS offices and a counselor or specialist's recommendations for accommodating your needs.
 
 As required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), accommodations are provided to insure equal opportunity for students with verified disabilities. If you need assistance with an accommodation, please contact the [Learning Skills Program](http://www.cabrillo.edu/academics/learningskills/) at 831-479-6220 (for students with learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders) or [Disabled Student Programs and Services](http://www.cabrillo.edu/services/dsps/index.html) (DSPS) at 831-479-6379 or 831-479-6421 (TTY) to make arrangements as soon as possible.
 
Students interested in receiving accommodations and services can contact the ASC at (831) 479-6379 to schedule an appointment to meet with one of the ASC counselors. Please arrive 15 minutes prior to the scheduled appointment to fill out necessary paperwork.
ASC is located outside Room 1073 in The Hub, upstairs behind the library.
Missing Classes and DropsIt is the student's responsibility to officially withdraw from classes. If you miss more than two classes or two lab assignments, the instructor may drop you from the course enrollment unless prior arrangements have been made and agreed to.
