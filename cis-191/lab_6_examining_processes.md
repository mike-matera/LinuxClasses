IntroductionIn this lab you will examine processes in depth. For this lab you will pick complex processes. Answer the questions in Part 1 and Part 2 for each of the following processes:
  * The X-Windows server (/usr/bin/X)
  * Firefox (/usr/lib/firefox/firefox)
  * compiz (The 3D compositor that makes your desktop pretty)

Part 1: Find the Processor StatsFor this part you must use the tools you learned in class to determine some important statistics about the processes. When things go wrong with a process these are very important to know. With the process you picked answer the following questions:
  - How many threads does the process have?
  - What is the total amount of time the process has been running on the processor?
  - What is the total amount of memory the process is using?

Part 2: File DescriptorsFind the open files that the process has and answer the following questions:
  - What files do STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR point to? Hint: If you don't know what those are Google "File descriptor"
  - What normal files does the process have open?

Part 3: System StatisticsNow you will need to find information about your overall system.
  - How long has it been since your system has started?
  - How much free memory does your system have?
  - In the last second how many blocks have been read from and written to your disk?

Turn InSubmit the answers to the above questions on Blackboard. Remember you must answer each question in Part 1 and Part 2 for each of the three processes you are to examine.
