## Customize your Splash Screen 

Spruce up the boot process on your VM by selecting a custom splash image. The[Ubuntu documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Displays)shows you how. Note that not all pictures can be made into splash screens there are requirements on the resolution and file types. In order to complete this lab you should:

  - Set the boot timeout to 30 seconds so your splash screen stays visible for a while.
  - Select a splash image and load it into grub.

## Lab Questions 

  - Why shouldn't you edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg manually?

Take a screenshot of your splash screen and submit it on Canvas
